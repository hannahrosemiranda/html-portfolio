    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All-time</h2>

<br/>
<h3>Coraline</h3>

    <p> An stop-motion animated movie, it is a dark fantasy horror genre. <br/> 
        The film tells the story of its titular character discovering <br/>
        an idealized parallel universe hehind a secret door in her new home, <br/>
        unaware that it contains a dark and sinister secret. Though this is a thriller <br/>
        movie, I learned that the relationship between children and parents <br/>
        is important and should be given due effort. <br/>

<h3>13 Going on 30</h3>

        <p> I just recently watched this movie, this easy to watch, light hearted film <br/>
            has the right amount of comedy and emotion creating an extremely impact storyline <br/>
            and performance. This taught me despite having the thought that adulthood are great, <br/>
            then we will realize that the process are the most important. <br/>

<h3>Purple Hearts</h3>

        <p> It's a great movie, I want to rewatch it. <br/>
            It felt like love can between any two people who are genuine <br/>
            enough and can be with each at their worst. Also the songs written <br/>
            are very much lovely the way they have written and played by the artist. <br/>
            The concert, the song writing made me remember my love for music. <br/>
